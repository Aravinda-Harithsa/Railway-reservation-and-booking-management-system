# Railway reservation and booking management System 
Note for Peer review :- This is still in progress ...( can run the file under src in implementation) ---> Unit test will be added by end of day 
* Railway reservation system using C language and Concepts of Data Structure like Linked lists, stacks Queues  with file Handling and database
* In the Railway reservation system we have  developed a platform to make the reservation system more efficient and bug free . It explains the systematic procedure of railway reservation in Indian railways . 



# Introduction:-

Used Concepts of data structures : Linked lists, stacks Queues, to build a basic Railway Reservation System in C Programming language. If the reservation is full, prompt reservation full!! Put them in waiting list (queue) and give a waiting list number. If a passenger wishes to cancel his ticket, he may cancel. Then the passenger in waiting list is booked automatically.


**Steps :** 

1. Build the Main.c file 
2. Run the exe file
